# Slicer settings and tuning

Tune your printer, especially the linear advance value, to prevent blobbing. 3-5 perimeters will make the part strong enough. About 0.15mm layer height.

# Updated slicer

Use a slicer with variable extrusion width. Cura 5 and PrusaSlicer 2.5 both have this. This will make the rails much better.

# Splitting clamps

Move the 2 halves of the Junglecat clamps. Then enable supports.

# Manual vertical supports

Only the Joycon lock notch has a support in vertical mode.

# Manual horizontal supports 

Manual supports are used for some overhangs to prevent sagging. Cut away with a craft knife or sharp box cutter.

You have to do the Junglecat and Joycon rails by hand. Good luck! Try printing the vertical versions with no cutting.
