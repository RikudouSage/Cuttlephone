# Slicer settings and tuning

Tune your printer, especially the linear advance value, to prevent blobbing. 3-5 perimeters will make the part strong enough. About 0.15mm layer height.

# Printing Joy-Con rails

Variable extrusion width in the slicer will make the rails much better. Cura 5.0 and PrusaSlicer 2.5 both have this feature. Some companies reskin Cura as their own slicer - use the latest version of regular Cura instead.

# Splitting clamps

Import the model into your slicer. Split the model and separate the 2 halves. Enable supports on the build plate. Don't support the inside of the sliding slot.

# Manual vertical supports
The Joy-Con rails have manual supports. Move them along with the clamp.

# Manual horizontal supports 

Manual supports are used for some overhangs to prevent sagging. Cut away with a craft knife or sharp box cutter.

You must cut the Junglecat and Joycon rails by hand. Good luck! Try printing the vertical versions with no cutting.
