# Slicer settings and tuning

Tune your printer and slicer. Epsecially tune the linear advance setting to prevent blobbing. 3-5 perimeters. About 0.15mm layer height.

If you can print a pretty Benchy then you can print this phone case. My overhangs here could've been a little better but this is more than good enough:

Variable extrusion width in the slicer will make the rails much better. Cura 5.0 and PrusaSlicer 2.5 both have this feature. Some companies reskin Cura as their own slicer - use the latest version of regular Cura instead.

# Materials

The hard cases can be made using PLA+, PETG, or ABS/ASA. Ductile materials. Plain PLA is too brittle and it will crack. Any brand of PLA+ (PLA Pro) will work, from Polymaker to eSun.

The soft cases can be made from TPU with a hardness of 90A or more. Overture High Speed TPU is the only one I've used and it's the perfect stiffness for a phone case. Supposedly this material works in bowden printers like the Ender 3.

# Splitting clamps

Import the model into your slicer. Split the model and separate the 2 halves. Enable supports on the build plate. Don't support the inside of the sliding slot.

# Manual vertical supports
The Joy-Con rails have manual supports. Move them along with the clamp.

# Manual horizontal supports 

Manual supports are used for some overhangs to prevent sagging. Cut away with a craft knife or sharp box cutter.

You must cut the Junglecat and Joycon rails by hand. Good luck! Try printing the vertical versions with no cutting.
