# To-do
 - Make a really good phone case
 - Finish gamepad prototype (write firmware, assemble PCB, 3D print case)
 - Demo and test prototype with friends
 - Community feedback, brainstorm v2


# How can I help?
Stick around until the prototype is finished! Follow the project with the links above. I'm open to suggestions.

# Roadmap

####  Prototype
 - Be a functional gamepad that works with Android
 - Cases for the team's personal phones
 - Controls for 2D-era emulation: D-Pad, 4 face buttons, 2 shoulder buttons, Start/Select
#### Public project
 - Ensure it's pocket-portable, make it easy to carry on a daily basis
 - Improve the button hardware, case design, etc based on testing
 - Cases for other phones (community help needed)
#### Future goals
 - Controls for 3D-era emulation: 2 joysticks, 2 analog triggers, some kind of L3/R3
 - Charging pass through
 - 3.5mm headphone jack
 - USB-C hub for additional features and DIY
#### Stretch goals
 - Analog face buttons for MGS1-3 compatibility
 - PCB art
